### Front-End Miami's Code of Conduct

The Front-End Miami MeetUp group expects that network activities, events, and digital forums:

1. Are a safe and respectful environment for all participants.
2. Are a place where people are free to fully express their identities.
3. Presume the value of others. Everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions have value.
4. Don’t assume everyone has the same context, and encourage questions.
5. Find a way for people to be productive with their skills (technical and not) and energy. Use language such as “yes/and”, not “no/but.”
6. Encourage members and participants to listen as much as they speak.
7. Work to ensure that the community is well-represented in the planning, design, and implementation of technology. This includes encouraging participation from women, minorities, and traditionally marginalized groups.
8. Provide an environment where people are free from discrimination or harassment.

Front-End Miami reserves the right to ask anyone in violation of these policies not to participate in Front-End Miami activities, events, and digital forums.

### Front-End Miami’s Anti-Harassment Policy

This anti-harassment policy is based on Code for America’s policy, itself based on the example policy from the Geek Feminism wiki, created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.

This policy is based on several other policies, including the Ohio LinuxFest anti-harassment policy, written by Esther Filderman and Beth Lynn Eicher, and the Con Anti-Harassment Project. Mary Gardiner, Valerie Aurora, Sarah Smith, and Donna Benjamin generalized the policies and added supporting material. Many members of LinuxChix, Geek Feminism and other groups contributed to this work.


All Front-End Miami network activities, events, and digital forums and their staff, presenters, and participants are held to an anti-harassment policy, included below.

Front-End Miami is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of staff, presenters, and participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate for any Front-End Miami event or network activity, including talks. Anyone in violation of these policies may be expelled from Front-End Miami network activities, events, and digital forums, at the discretion of the event organizer or forum administrator.

Harassment includes but is not limited to: offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; unwelcome sexual attention; unwarranted exclusion; and patronizing language or action.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from Front-End Miami network activities, events, and digital forums.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event staff or forum administrator immediately. You can contact them at organizers@Front-End.miami. Event staff or forum administrators will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.

If you cannot reach an event organizer or forum administrator and/or it is an emergency, please call 911 and/or remove yourself from the situation.

We value your attendance and hope that by communicating these expectations widely we can all enjoy a harassment-free environment.
